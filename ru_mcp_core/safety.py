"""Safety gating for write/destructive operations.

Marketplace API keys grant power over prices, stocks and money. A misfired
write can drop a price 3x or zero out stock. We gate mutations locally, before
the request leaves the machine.

Levels:
- read        : no confirmation needed
- write       : requires confirm_write=True
- destructive : requires confirm_write=True AND i_understand_this_modifies_data=True
